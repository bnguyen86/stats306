Report for team project. To hand in: email a zip file (less than 9MB) with (a) report in pdf file (file name with surnames of group members) ; (b) data set as text, csv or tsv; (c) R code files that can be run in batch mode, e.g., with source()
If zip file is more than 9MB, it will be rejected by the Departmental email server; in this case, use give me a DropBox URL or something similar.
Goals: Show that you can use properly use material covered in the course, in particular 
(a) variable selection and creation of explanatory variables, 
(b) residual plots to decide on transforms, quadratic terms and interactions (see Section 4.4 on transforms and nonlinearity), 
(c) cross-validation comparisons of a few "good" models.

Report writing guidelines (use Chapter 5 of coursepack as a template)

-Section 1 summary/abstract: this section includes the goals of your project and the main conclusions.
-Section 2: describe your variables and include summary statistics and frequency tables (the latter for categorical variables), and some scatterplots.
-Next sections: outline of analyses to support your main conclusions.
-Appendix: R code and secondary plots (only most important plots are needed in the main part of the report) -- the Appendix is for your own reference when you need to do a future project.
-Label tables and graphs so that they can be understood without referring to the text in the report.
-Units of variables (where appropriate) should be included in tables and in the writing.
-In the main body of the report (not including Appendix), do not use too many (significant) digits. Sample means and SDs: one more digit beyond the raw data is enough.
